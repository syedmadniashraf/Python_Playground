# We are going to write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to
# guess it.
# If the player’s guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays “Lower
# number please”. Similarly, if the user’s guess is too low, the program prints “higher
# number please” When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the
# number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number.

# Hint: Use the random module.
